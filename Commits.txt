0 - Made trail and fixed layers (see commits.txt 0)
Added the commit file. This file is to write more about the changes and additions in each commit, because I have a tendency to get off track and then do something else. This will allow me to write all the information I want. New text will be added to the end of this file in the future.

Made the trail class. It is used to create a trail behind the leading party member for the trailing party members to follow. The class has also been made able to fulfill that purpose. In the future I might make a modified version that I use to make trails for the NPCs to follow while they go about their day, but that is a low priority.

Found the reason for the wacky framerate issues that happen at regular intervals even though, currently, each frame should be remarkably similar. I was wondering if I should use Raylib to unload the texture2Ds and RenderTexture2Ds that I use for the layer effect, because Raylib seems to also be for C++ and they usually need to do that manually. Well, now I have my answer, I very much need to unload them.

Not really an update but I decided to test if the GameMaster delegates that return an Actor actually allowed them to be collected by garbage collection like I hoped. I found that the very act of calling the delegate, and that alone, made it unable to be picked up by garbage collection, even if the delegate itself is forgotten. I'm going to try simply ignoring it until that no longer becomes possible.


1 - Fix Trail direction and vector to int
I gave the Player class a function to turn a vector into an integer that represents a direction. Here, I even made a chart.
7   8   9
  \ | /
4 - 5 - 6   (It's based on the configuration of the number-pad on most keyboards)
  / | \
1   2   3
In the future, this will be used to get the correct sprite from a class with an index of sprites. Speaking of which, I might want to start working on that.
While doing that I also noticed that the Trail classes GetDirectionAt didn't actually work, so I had to fix it.
Also. I forgot to mention that a number will be included in the commit message which relates to the section of this file that includes more information.


2 - Made SpriteSheet, changed vector to int
I made the sprite sheet class and a bunch of functionality from it. It should be done. When loading an image (in png format, always) it needs a complimentary json file that describes metadata. 
I realised I don't need a value for lack of direction because that should never happen, and I don't want to make 8 different animations for walking (5 if I mirror them), so I'm just going to make 4 (3 if I mirror them) and change the vector to int to match that.
3   4   1
  \ | /
3 - X - 1  (Based on a clock, with the highest number on the top)
  / | \
3   2   1
The reason there are three 1s and 3s each4 is because I want it to favour the sprites of horizontal movement, though I might change that if it looks bad.


3 - Player uses SpriteSheet
Player can now use SpriteSheet, though it doesn't really use animations yet. I mentioned in the commit where I added the test image and it's metadata that it was probably broken. Surprisingly enough, it was not.

4 - Messed up test sheet
Scratch that previous one, I accidentally made the sprite for standing while looking left instead point to the right. How did I miss that?
