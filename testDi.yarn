Natan: Time for some wacky testing!
Natan: First, time to try the size markup, both [size=big]big[/size] and [size=small]small[/size].
Natan: Next, We try the colors. We have [color=red]red[/], [color=green]green[/], and [blue=0000ff]blue[/].
Natan: [color=aa]This[/], [color=aaff]this[/], [color=aaaaaa]this[/], and even [color=aaaaaaff]this[/], should all be the same shade of grey. But [color=aa00]this[/] should be invisible.
